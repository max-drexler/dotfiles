Configuration Files
===================

My custom config files and rcs.

Heavily inspired by [@bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10/dotfiles).


Installation
------------

Inside the repository you can run `install` to place the configs in `~`.
This will symlink them from the repository, so you can easily update with `git
pull`.
